Code the index view file for the attached  DeliveryController attached to the project. FOLLOW THE EXACT DESIGN of SHADCNUI WIZARD/TAB NAV . DO NOT USE SVGs USE iconsas a must . NO SUCH ERRORS ARE TO HAPPEN ,"stdClass as array," AND ALL TYPES OF PHP OR BLADE ERRORS, STUDY THE LOGIC OF THE CONTROLLER LOGIC AND FUNCTION SUPPLYING THE VIEW AND MAP OUT ALL LOGIC AND USE IT WITH 100% ACCURACY AND ALSO ENSURE EACH VIEW IS CODED WITH ENGINEERING THAT AGGRESSIVELLY REDUCES CODE BY A INSANE MARGINES BUT 100% ACCOMODATES ALL EXPECTED FUNCTIONALITY AND LOOK AND NO USELESS CODE SHOULD BE IN THE VIEW OR APPROACHES THAT USE ALOT OF CODE.  DO NOT CODE VIEW FILES THAT LONG Start by telling me the file you are going to code , FOR EACH VIEW ALSO SHOW DELIBERATE ACCOMODATE  FOR PREMIUM LOOKS COMPLIANCE TO BOTH TAILWIND and FOLLOW THE SHADCNUI 100% DESIGN SYSTEM AND DEFAULT COLORS 1000%  AND ERROR PREVENTION STRATEGY FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE CONTROLLER and   DESIGN PATTERNS YOU ARE GOING TO USE should  BEAT THE TOP 10 BRANDS AND TOP 10 UI DEVS AT THEIR OWN GAME TO DEVELIVER ABSOLUTE PREMIUM DESIGN WITH VERY LITTLE CODE FOOTPRINT. USE A WIZARD/TABS LIKE APPROACH AND ALL ERRORS FROM THE CONTROLLER ALLL POSSIBLE ERRRORS SHOULD BE CAUGHT AND SHOWN IN SWAL2 WHERE NEED BE , CODE ONLY ONE FILE AT A TIME.

ðŸ“‹ MODULE 1: FOUNDATION & AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM
MODULE SCOPE & BUSINESS CONTEXT
This module establishes the security foundation for the entire fuel ERP system, implementing user authentication, role-based access control, comprehensive audit trails, and forensic-level data integrity mechanisms. Every action in the system will flow through this foundation, ensuring complete accountability and tamper-proof operation.
CONTROLLERS & FUNCTIONALITY BREAKDOWN
1. AuthController - Authentication Core Engine
File: app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php
Methods & Complete Functionality:
login(Request $request)

Business Logic: Multi-factor authentication with account lockout protection
Validation: Email format, password strength, rate limiting
Process Flow:

Validate credentials against users table with exact column names
Check account_locked_until timestamp vs current time
Increment failed_attempts counter on failure (max 3)
Create session with user_id, user_role, station_assignments
Log successful/failed attempts to audit_logs with IP tracking
Generate hash chain entry for authentication event


CEO/SYSTEM_ADMIN Special Handling: No lockout restrictions, enhanced logging
Security Features: Bcrypt verification, IP tracking, device fingerprinting
Tables Used: users, audit_logs, hash_chains, user_stations

logout(Request $request)

Business Logic: Secure session termination with audit trail
Process Flow:

Capture session duration and activity statistics
Log logout event to audit_logs with session metadata
Clear all session data and invalidate tokens
Update last_logout_timestamp in users table
Generate hash chain entry for logout event


Audit Requirements: Complete session summary, action count, data accessed

resetPassword(Request $request)

Business Logic: Secure password reset workflow with email verification
Process Flow:

Validate email exists in users table
Generate cryptographically secure reset token
Store token with expiration (15 minutes) in password_resets table
Send email with reset link using queue system
Log reset request to audit_logs
On completion, force password change and clear failed_attempts


Security Features: Token expiration, one-time use, old password invalidation

lockAccount($userId)

Business Logic: Immediate account lockout for security breaches
Process Flow:

Set account_locked_until to 15 minutes from current time
Terminate all active sessions for user
Log lockout reason and triggering event
Send notification email to user and supervisor
Generate hash chain entry for security event


CEO/SYSTEM_ADMIN Immunity: Cannot be locked by system, requires manual override


2. UserController - User Lifecycle Management
File: app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php
Methods & Complete Functionality:
index(Request $request)

Business Logic: Filtered user listing with role-based visibility
Data Flow:

Query users table with exact column names (employee_number, first_name, last_name, role, etc.)
Apply role-based filtering (STATION_MANAGER sees only same station users)
Include user_stations relationships for station assignments
Calculate activity metrics (last_login, actions_count, variance_approvals)
Paginate results with search/filter capabilities


UI Features: Advanced filtering, bulk actions, export capabilities
Performance: Optimized queries with proper indexing

create(Request $request)

Business Logic: New user creation with auto-generated credentials
Validation Rules:

email: unique:users,email|email:rfc
role: in:SYSTEM_ADMIN,CEO,STATION_MANAGER,DELIVERY_SUPERVISOR,AUDITOR
station_id: exists:stations,id (for STATION_MANAGER role)


Process Flow:

Auto-generate employee_number (EMP001, EMP002...)
Create unique username from first_name + last_name
Generate temporary password with complexity requirements
Set role-based permissions (can_approve_variances, can_modify_prices)
Send welcome email with credentials
Log user creation to audit_logs with hash chain

Revoke access to previous stations if removed
Update session data if user is currently logged in
Log assignment changes with effective dates


Business Rules: STATION_MANAGER limited to 3 stations max

permissions($id, Request $request)

Business Logic: Granular permission management with approval workflow
Permission Matrix:

can_approve_variances: CEO/SYSTEM_ADMIN auto-approve, others require justification
can_modify_prices: High-value permission requiring dual approval
